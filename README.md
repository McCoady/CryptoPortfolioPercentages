# CryptoPortfolioPercentages

Upper Beginner Python programmer embarking on a mini project mainly to learn how to use git & github, while sharpeing my OOP, data vis and webscraper/api skills.

Goals of the project:

    • Add fiat invested
    
    • Add coins and their quantities
    
    • Get conversions for coin prices (into GBP/USD/BTC)
    
    • Give user portfolio total value, profit/loss
    
    • Show user % of portfolio allocated to each coin, (table/piechart/pareto diagram)
    
    • Save a checkpoint for this (allocation spread, date) which can be compared against in future
    
    • Allow users to input target % allocations
    
    • Suggest necessary adjustments to reach desired % allocation
